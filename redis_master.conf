# Custom Redis configuration for development
# This ensures Redis starts as a master by not including a 'replicaof' or 'slaveof' directive.
# Default Redis behavior without these directives is to be a master.

# Explicitly ensure this Redis instance is a master (not a replica)
# Remove any replicaof configuration to prevent read-only mode
# replicaof <masterip> <masterport>  # COMMENTED OUT - this would make it a replica

# To allow connections from other Docker containers on the same network:
bind 0.0.0.0

# Allow connections without password for development
protected-mode no

# Ensure this instance can accept writes (master mode)
# replica-read-only yes  # COMMENTED OUT - only applies to replicas

# Add any other specific configurations needed for your dev environment below.
# For example, to set a password:
# requirepass yourpassword

# Log level (optional, default is notice)
loglevel notice

# Save configuration
save 900 1
save 300 10
save 60 10000

# Enable AOF for better persistence
appendonly yes
appendfsync everysec
