# Custom Redis configuration for development
# This ensures Redis starts as a master by not including a 'replicaof' or 'slaveof' directive.
# Default Redis behavior without these directives is to be a master.

# To allow connections from other Docker containers on the same network:
# bind 0.0.0.0

# If you are using a Redis version < 6, you might need 'protected-mode no' if binding to 0.0.0.0 without a password.
# protected-mode no

# Add any other specific configurations needed for your dev environment below.
# For example, to set a password:
# requirepass yourpassword

# Log level (optional, default is notice)
# loglevel debug
